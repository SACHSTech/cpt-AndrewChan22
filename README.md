Data set: https://ourworldindata.org/life-expectancy

This data set is on life expectancies around the world. However, I wanted to narrow it down to a few specific countries around the world to provide a more holistic view of life expectancies around the world. This dataset consists of years starting from 1800, and ending in 2021. Life expectancy is an important metric to take a closer look at as it is a key indicator for assessing the health of a population. Life expectancy is also a good indicator when looking at the overall establishment of a country, as developing countries tend to have lower life expectancies. This dataset that I used contained countries from all around the world, but I have decided to reduce the amount of data to zone in on a few countries. 

I selected this data set because I think that it is important to look at the life expectancies of different countries. Life expectancy doesn't just tell us the average length a person is expected to live in a certain area of the world, but it also allows us to examine the overall improvements or deterioration of a country's living standards. I wanted to really see the difference between the life expectancies of a first-world country such as Canada, compared to other areas in the world. This program allows others to examine countries in a broader sense, and to understand the situations of certain countries.
